# Book-Manager
This small website is developed as a mini project to practice Vanilla Javascript.  
Since i like reading books i decided to create a simple book manager that i can use to store summaries i write and quotes i like.  
It has two pages: 

      * page 1: divided into two parts:  
      
                * Form(book's name, author's name, summary, highlights, quotes, submit)  
                * Filter input :filters books and a list of the books added(each time a book is added to the list when we click submit until the length of the   
                list reaches 10 for the readabilty of the page but all of them are stored in the Local Storage).  
    * page 2: Displays book content on click in the main page.  
    
            * Home button: directs you to the main page when clicked  
            * Update button: updates the content of the book(when clicked it opens the main page with the form filled with the book content ready to be updated.
